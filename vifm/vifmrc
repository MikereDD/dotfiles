#Trash Directory
# The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to
# the trash directory.  1 means use the trash directory 0 means
# just use rm.  If you change this you will not be able to move
# files by deleting them and then using p to put the file in the new location.
# I recommend not changing this until you are familiar with vifm.
# This probably shouldn't be an option.
